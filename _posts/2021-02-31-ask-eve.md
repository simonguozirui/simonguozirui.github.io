Valentine's Day is right around the corner. Some friends and I got together and hacked up a bot that writes love letters! 

Put in the first sentence of the letter you want to write, and add a few keywords, the AI will write the rest for you!

You can also set the mood of the letter, such as a confession, apology, thinking of someone, etc.

We used OpenAI's GPT-2 text generation model and finetuned it on some datasets of love letters, and generate the text using an RNN.
